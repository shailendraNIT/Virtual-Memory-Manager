The purpose of Project  was  to learn how to convert a logical address to a physical address by instantiating and using our own page table and tlb. The program verifies that a valid text file has been input in the command prompt when running the program Next, the program opens 2 files for reading, addresses.txt and BACKING_STORE.bin and creates another file for writing, Output.txt. The program will print its outputs into this file, but it will not print the outputs on the command prompt since not all of the outputs are displayed. Then the program will continue with the reading of each address and get the page number and offset number for each address. Then it consults the tlb to see if the page number is already in the tlb. if it is, then it is a tlb hit and proceeds to get the frame number and the physical page number. Then it stores the values of the offset and the physical page number in a variable, giving us the physical address. If it is not in the tlb, then it will be a tlb miss and will go to the page table to get the physical address number from the page table. If it goes to the page table it is a page fault. then it will store the physical address and the offset in a variable which would give us the physical address.
